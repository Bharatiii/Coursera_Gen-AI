Q.2.Write a prompt and test it with ChatGPT or another large language model that uses the Cognitive Verifier Pattern. Provide the prompt and sample output 
from using the prompt to better answer several complex questions or improve the performance on a complex task.

Ans-
Prompt: Use the Cognitive Verifier Pattern to improve responses to complex questions. This involves analyzing the assumptions behind the question, 
identifying potential gaps in reasoning or knowledge, and verifying the correctness and completeness of the answer. Apply this pattern to the following 
complex questions to ensure the responses are well-founded and accurate:

How will AI completely replace human jobs in the next decade?
Is nuclear energy the best solution for the global energy crisis?
Can blockchain technology eliminate financial fraud?
Will renewable energy sources fully meet global energy demand by 2050?
Should governments regulate AI development to prevent future risks?
Sample Output:

Original Question: How will AI completely replace human jobs in the next decade?

Cognitive Verifier Response:

Assumption Check: The question assumes AI will completely replace all human jobs, which may be an overgeneralization. Current trends suggest 
AI is more likely to augment rather than fully replace human roles in most sectors.
Gap in Reasoning: The question doesnâ€™t consider the sectors where human creativity, emotional intelligence, or decision-making are critical.
Verified Answer: AI is unlikely to completely replace human jobs in the next decade. Instead, it will automate repetitive tasks, while creating 
new jobs in AI management, machine-human collaboration, and specialized sectors requiring human oversight.
Original Question: Is nuclear energy the best solution for the global energy crisis?

Cognitive Verifier Response:

Assumption Check: This question assumes nuclear energy is the best or only solution, ignoring other potential options like renewable energy 
sources or advancements in energy storage.
Gap in Reasoning: The question overlooks the challenges of nuclear waste disposal, high costs, and public safety concerns.
Verified Answer: Nuclear energy could be a part of the solution to the global energy crisis due to its low carbon emissions and reliability, 
but it should be considered alongside renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydro, which are becoming increasingly cost-effective and sustainable.
Original Question: Can blockchain technology eliminate financial fraud?

Cognitive Verifier Response:

Assumption Check: The question assumes blockchain technology can eliminate financial fraud entirely, without considering the broader scope 
of fraud mechanisms.
Gap in Reasoning: While blockchain can secure transaction records and improve transparency, it does not prevent fraud in areas like identity 
theft or offline activities.
Verified Answer: Blockchain can significantly reduce the risk of financial fraud by providing immutable records and transparency, but it 
cannot eliminate fraud entirely. Fraud schemes targeting vulnerabilities in human behavior, identity verification, and offline systems still pose risks.
Original Question: Will renewable energy sources fully meet global energy demand by 2050?

Cognitive Verifier Response:

Assumption Check: The question assumes that technological advancements and political will are sufficient to make renewable energy the dominant 
energy source globally by 2050.
Gap in Reasoning: The question does not consider regional disparities in energy infrastructure, financial constraints, or the current reliance on 
fossil fuels.
Verified Answer: While renewable energy sources are expected to play a major role in meeting global energy demand by 2050, it is uncertain whether 
they will fully meet the demand due to infrastructure challenges, economic factors, and the need for advancements in energy storage and distribution.
Original Question: Should governments regulate AI development to prevent future risks?

Cognitive Verifier Response:

Assumption Check: The question assumes that regulation is the only or best way to prevent future risks associated with AI development.
Gap in Reasoning: The question does not consider the balance between innovation and regulation, as overly strict regulations could stifle 
technological progress, while a lack of oversight could lead to ethical and security concerns.
Verified Answer: Governments should implement thoughtful regulations to manage the risks of AI development, focusing on transparency, accountability, 
and ethical considerations. However, regulations should be flexible enough to allow for innovation and adaptation to the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

In each refined response, the Cognitive Verifier Pattern ensures that the assumptions behind the questions are critically examined, leading to more balanced and well-supported answers.
