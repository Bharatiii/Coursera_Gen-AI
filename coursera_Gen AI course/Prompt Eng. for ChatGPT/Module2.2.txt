Ans-
Question:
What are some significant technological innovations or scientific breakthroughs introduced in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) 
or quantum computing since 2021?

Sample Output
Since 2021, several significant advancements have emerged in the fields of artificial intelligence and quantum computing:

Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs): AI has made remarkable progress, particularly in natural language processing (NLP). 
Models like GPT-4 (released in 2023) demonstrate enhanced capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. These models have improved 
contextual understanding and can perform complex reasoning, creative writing, and problem-solving tasks. OpenAI and Google DeepMind have continued 
to advance LLMs, making them more efficient and accessible for various applications, including education, coding, and healthcare.

AI for Drug Discovery: AI has accelerated the drug discovery process. DeepMind’s AlphaFold revolutionized biology by predicting protein structures 
with high accuracy, which had major implications for understanding diseases and developing treatments. As of 2022, AlphaFold had predicted the 
structures of nearly every known protein, contributing to breakthroughs in areas like cancer research and biotechnology.

Quantum Supremacy and Practical Quantum Computers: Google and IBM continued to make strides in quantum computing. In 2022, IBM unveiled the 
Eagle processor, a 127-qubit quantum chip, which pushed the boundaries of quantum performance. This chip is considered a significant step towards 
achieving quantum supremacy—the point at which quantum computers outperform classical computers in practical applications. These advancements promise 
to revolutionize industries such as cryptography, materials science, and complex system simulations.

AI in Autonomous Systems: AI's integration into autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones, has grown. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, 
and others have made improvements to AI-driven navigation systems. By 2023, advancements in AI algorithms have significantly improved the reliability 
and safety of autonomous driving, although full autonomy remains under development.
Ethics and Regulation of AI: Governments and organizations have been focusing on the ethical implications of AI. 
In 2023, the European Union made progress in drafting the AI Act, which aims to regulate high-risk AI systems and ensure 
their development aligns with ethical guidelines to protect privacy, prevent discrimination, and promote transparency.

These innovations and breakthroughs demonstrate the rapid pace of AI and quantum computing development, with applications ranging from scientific 
research to industry and society at large.



Q.2.Create a prompt and test it with a large language model, such as ChatGPT, that introduces new information since 2021. Please only use public 
information. Do NOT use information that is private, subject to legal restrictions, or otherwise should not be shared with Coursera, ChatGPT, 
the instructor, etc. The prompt should require the large language model to perform a task, other than answering a question, with the information. 
Please provide your prompt and the output as the answer.

Ans-
Here is an example of a prompt that introduces new public information since 2021 and requires a large language model to perform a task:

Prompt: In 2023, several developments occurred in AI research, such as the release of GPT-4 by OpenAI, which improved language 
understanding and processing capabilities. Additionally, there has been a focus on the ethical implications of AI, particularly with the rise of 
large-scale models. Using this information, generate a report outlining three key advancements in AI from 2022 to 2023. Then, suggest two ethical 
concerns that might arise with these advancements and propose possible solutions to address them.
Output:

Report on AI Advancements (2022-2023):

a.GPT-4 Release (2023): OpenAI released GPT-4, a highly advanced language model, which significantly improved upon GPT-3 by enhancing its 
ability to understand complex queries and generate more coherent and context-aware responses. It supports more languages, better handles nuanced 
conversations, and offers improved text generation, making it a powerful tool for applications in customer service, content creation, and research.

b.AI in Drug Discovery (2022): AI played a pivotal role in accelerating drug discovery processes. By analyzing vast datasets, AI models helped identify 
promising compounds for treatments faster than traditional methods. In 2022, AI-assisted drug discovery led to breakthroughs in treatments for 
diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's, showing potential in reducing the time and cost of developing new therapies.

c.AI-Assisted Autonomous Systems (2023): AI advancements have improved the capabilities of autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and drones. 
By integrating more sophisticated machine learning algorithms, these systems can make safer and more reliable decisions in real-time, reducing the 
likelihood of accidents and improving operational efficiency.

Ethical Concerns and Solutions-

a.Bias in AI Models: As AI models become more powerful, the risk of embedding bias in their outputs increases. This can lead to unfair treatment in 
areas like hiring, law enforcement, and healthcare.

Solution: Implement more rigorous fairness assessments during the training phase, and use diverse datasets that represent a wide range of demographics 
to reduce bias. Additionally, regular audits and transparency in AI decision-making processes should be mandated.

b.Job Displacement: AI systems are automating more jobs, especially in fields like customer service, manufacturing, and transportation. 
This could lead to significant job losses in certain sectors.

Solution: Governments and industries should invest in retraining and upskilling programs to help workers transition into new roles where human 
skills are still in demand, such as in creative, managerial, or technical fields.
