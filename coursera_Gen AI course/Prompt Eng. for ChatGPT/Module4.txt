Q.1.Write a prompt and test it with ChatGPT or another large language model that uses few-shot examples to teach the large language model to perform a 
complex task. Provide the prompt and sample output from using the prompt.

Ans-
Prompt: I’m going to provide you with a few examples of how to summarize academic research papers in a concise manner, emphasizing the main argument, 
methodology, and findings. After seeing the examples, you’ll be asked to summarize a new paper using the same pattern.

Example 1:

Paper Title: "The Impact of Climate Change on Global Agricultural Productivity"

Summary: This paper investigates how climate change affects global agricultural output by analyzing data from 50 countries over 20 years. 
The authors use a regression analysis to identify correlations between rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and crop yields. 
The findings suggest that while some regions may benefit from longer growing seasons, overall global productivity is expected to decline by 10-15% by 
2050 due to increased frequency of extreme weather events and reduced water availability.

Example 2:

Paper Title: "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Enhancing Diagnosis Accuracy"

Summary: This research examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving diagnostic accuracy in healthcare. 
The authors conduct a meta-analysis of 100 clinical studies that compare AI-driven diagnostic tools to traditional methods. 
Results show that AI can improve diagnostic accuracy by up to 20%, particularly in areas like radiology and pathology, 
though the paper also highlights the need for further research on integrating AI with existing healthcare systems to ensure widespread 
adoption and minimize error risks.

Example 3:

Paper Title: "Blockchain and Financial Systems: Security and Efficiency"

Summary: The paper explores the use of blockchain technology in enhancing the security and efficiency of financial systems. 
By reviewing case studies from five major financial institutions that implemented blockchain-based solutions, the authors demonstrate 
a reduction in transaction times by 40% and improved protection against fraud through decentralized ledgers. However, the paper also 
discusses scalability concerns and the high energy consumption associated with current blockchain models.

Task: Now, based on these examples, summarize the following paper:

Paper Title: "The Role of Remote Work in Employee Productivity Post-Pandemic"

Sample Output:

Summary: This paper explores the effects of remote work on employee productivity following the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors surveyed 500 employees 
from different industries who transitioned to remote work in 2020. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative productivity 
metrics with qualitative interviews. Results show that while productivity increased for employees with flexible schedules and appropriate home-office 
setups, others faced challenges like lack of collaboration and isolation. The paper concludes that remote work can enhance productivity if supported 
by proper infrastructure and organizational policies.




Q.2.Write a prompt and test it with ChatGPT or another large language model that uses few-shot examples to teach the large language model to 
perform a complex task that requires performing intermediate sub-steps. Provide the prompt and sample output from using the prompt.

Ans-
Prompt: I’m going to show you a few examples of how to solve complex mathematical word problems by breaking them down into intermediate sub-steps. 
After seeing the examples, you'll be asked to solve a new problem using the same approach.

Example 1:

Problem: A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. If the car continues at the same speed, how long will it take to travel 600 miles?

Solution:

Sub-step 1: Find the speed of the car.
Speed= Distance/Time
=
150 miles/3 hours
=50 miles per hour.
Sub-step 2: Use the speed to find how long it takes to travel 600 miles.
Time= Distance/speed=
600 miles/50 miles per hour
=12 hours.
Answer: It will take 12 hours to travel 600 miles.

Example 2:

Problem: A factory produces 240 widgets in 8 hours. How many widgets can the factory produce in 15 hours?

Solution:

Sub-step 1: Find the rate of production per hour.
Rate of production=
Time
Widgets=
240 widgets/ 8 hours
=30 widgets per hour.
Sub-step 2: Multiply the rate by the new time period (15 hours).
Widgets produced in 15 hours=30 widgets per hour×15 hours=450 widgets.
Answer: The factory can produce 450 widgets in 15 hours.

Example 3:

Problem: If a train travels 120 miles in 2 hours, and then 180 miles in 3 hours, what is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

Solution:

Sub-step 1: Find the total distance traveled.
Total distance=120 miles+180 miles=300 miles.
Sub-step 2: Find the total time taken.
Total time=2 hours+3 hours=5 hours.
Sub-step 3: Calculate the average speed using total distance and total time.
Average speed=60 miles per hour
Answer: The average speed of the train is 60 miles per hour.

Task: Now, solve the following problem by breaking it down into intermediate sub-steps.

Problem: A cyclist rides 50 miles in 2 hours, rests for 30 minutes, and then rides another 70 miles in 3 hours. What is the cyclist's average 
speed for the entire trip, including the rest time?

Sample Output:

Solution:

Sub-step 1: Convert the rest time to hours.
Rest time=30 minutes=0.5 hours.
Sub-step 2: Find the total time taken, including rest time.
Total time=2 hours+3 hours+0.5 hours=5.5 hours.
Sub-step 3: Find the total distance traveled.
Total distance=50 miles+70 miles=120 miles.
Sub-step 4: Calculate the average speed using the total distance and total time.
Average speed= Total distance/Total time
= 120 miles/5.5 hour ≈21.82 miles per hour.

Answer: The cyclist’s average speed for the entire trip, including rest time, is approximately 21.82 miles per hour.
