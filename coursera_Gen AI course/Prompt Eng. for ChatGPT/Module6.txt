Q.1.Develop your own prompt-based application, similar to the outlining application from the videos, to help you accomplish a task. 
Your application can do whatever you want and does not have to be focused on outlining. Come up with a creative way of using large language 
models to program an environment to solve a problem you face on a daily basis. 
Provide your prompt and a sample of using the prompt-based application. 


Ans-
Problem:
On busy days, it can be difficult to manage multiple tasks, prioritize them, and know where to start. This leads to feeling overwhelmed or unfocused.

Application Objective:
The Task Streamlining Assistant will take a list of tasks as input, break them down into manageable sub-tasks, and create a prioritized schedule 
based on estimated times and importance.

Prompt Structure:

User Input: A list of tasks, importance level, estimated time to complete, and preferred start/end times for the day.
Assistant Output: A structured schedule with suggested breaks, priority management, and an estimated completion time for the day.
Example Prompt:

Prompt to the assistant:

“I have 5 tasks to complete today. 
Task 1: Write a blog post (High priority, 2 hours), 
Task 2: Respond to emails (Medium priority, 30 minutes), 
Task 3: Design a presentation (High priority, 1.5 hours), 
Task 4: Client meeting prep (Low priority, 45 minutes), 
Task 5: Research project for proposal (Medium priority, 1.5 hours). I would like to start my day at 9 AM and finish by 5 PM, with at least one hour 
for lunch. Please help me organize this efficiently.”

Sample Output:

1.9:00 AM - 11:00 AM: Write a blog post (High priority)

2.11:00 AM - 11:30 AM: Respond to emails (Medium priority)

3.11:30 AM - 12:00 PM: Break

4.12:00 PM - 1:30 PM: Design presentation (High priority)

5.1:30 PM - 2:30 PM: Lunch break

6.2:30 PM - 3:15 PM: Client meeting prep (Low priority)

7.3:15 PM - 4:45 PM: Research project for proposal (Medium priority)

8.4:45 PM - 5:00 PM: Final check and wrap up

End of Day: 5:00 PM

This prompt-based application helps the user not only structure their day but also prevents burnout by introducing breaks, prioritizing important tasks, 
and estimating how long the entire day will take based on the time constraints provided.

Features:
1.Time allocation and optimization: Automatically manages task duration and ensures tasks fit within the given timeframe.

2.Break management: Suggests breaks to maintain productivity and focus.

3.Priority scheduling: Handles tasks based on their urgency and importance, ensuring that critical tasks are tackled first.
